# GoPuff-Database-Analysis-Design
A scalable database system for GoPuff, built using Oracle APEX, to optimize order processing, inventory management, and delivery logistics.

## Background and Overview
GoPuff is an on-demand delivery service that provides customers with everyday essentials, snacks, drinks, and other products. Unlike traditional delivery platforms, GoPuff stocks thousands of products in micro-fulfillment centers to optimize delivery efficiency.
The goal of this project is to develop a scalable database system to efficiently manage GoPuff’s online ordering platform. This database will enable seamless order processing, inventory tracking, customer management, and delivery optimization, ensuring timely deliveries and accurate inventory management.
To achieve this, Oracle APEX was used as the primary database management tool for designing, querying, and optimizing the system. Oracle APEX provides a low-code environment that allows for rapid database application development, making it an ideal choice for structuring GoPuff’s backend operations.

## Data Structure Overview
### Entity-Relationship (ER) Model & Relational Schema:
The Entity-Relationship (ER) model is designed to reflect GoPuff’s core business operations, ensuring seamless order fulfillment, real-time inventory tracking, and efficient delivery routing.
Customers and Orders Relationship: Customers place multiple orders, and each order is linked to a specific customer through a foreign key relationship (CustomerID → Orders).

Order Processing & Product Catalog: Orders contain multiple products, requiring a many-to-many relationship handled through an intermediate table (OrderLine), ensuring accurate transaction tracking.

Inventory Management & Fulfillment Centers: Each product is stocked in different micro-fulfillment centers, enabling real-time stock level updates and supply chain optimization.

Delivery & Logistics: Orders are assigned to available drivers, and tracking is maintained via the Delivery table, ensuring efficient dispatch and customer notifications.

The Relational Schema converts these business processes into a structured SQL-compatible format, implementing primary and foreign key constraints to enforce data integrity and streamline operational efficiency.
The ER model establishes relationships between customers, orders, products, and delivery hubs, ensuring a structured database framework.

The relational schema translates business processes into SQL-compatible tables with primary and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.
